# GameOfLIfe
Basic java implementation of the Conway's Game of Life. Purely console/text based currently. 

# Prerequisites:
Java 17 - [openJdk](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=807&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All)

# How to build:
Uses the Gradle Wrapper. 

On Mac: *./gradlew clean build*

On Windows: *gradlew.bat clean build*  (I think - I work only on Mac)
